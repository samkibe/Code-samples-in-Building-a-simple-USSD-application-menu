Code Snippets-in-Building-and-Testing-USSD-and-SMS-Applications

*Disclaimare* --
Sample codes are only formatted and placed on tangible soft copies to suit my learning objective, however, they are as created on -Africa's Talking- site and my course instructor Mr. Derdus Kenga, PhD || Content Developer II @Microsoft and, a part time Lecturer Strathmore University.

To test the code you can fire a simulator on Africa's Talking website. (Check their website for details)
or
You can do a manual code test on an installed Postman on your machine or a postman agent to help run postman on your browser, after ofcourse installing and starting apache on xampp.

Create a "Your-folder" on Xampp-Htdocs-your_folder- then open it on your preferred IED. THEN Create a php file - example.php. now you are good to go!

//Path to test on Postman:
as follows

localhost/'your_folder'/example.php
